## üß† Technologies Used

This project integrates several modern tools and services to handle authentication, database management, and AI model inference.

### üîê **Authentication & User Management**

**Auth.js (NextAuth.js)**  
Used to manage user sessions and authentication within the Next.js app.  
It provides secure, server-side session handling and easy integration with OAuth providers.

- **Why:** Simplifies authentication flow and session management.
- **Docs:** [https://authjs.dev](https://authjs.dev)

**Google OAuth via Firebase**  
Google sign-in is configured using Firebase and Auth.js for a seamless login experience.

- **Why:** Provides trusted and convenient authentication for users through their Google accounts.
- **Setup:** Uses `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` and `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` in `.env`.

---

### üî• **Database & Cloud Infrastructure**

**Firebase (Firestore & Admin SDK)**  
Used for real-time database operations and secure server-side access.

- **Firestore:** Stores user and chat data.
- **Firebase Admin SDK:** Handles privileged operations on the backend.
- **Why:** Provides scalable, secure, and easily managed cloud storage and authentication.
- **Env Variables:**
  - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` ‚Äî for server-side admin access.
  - `firebaseConfig` ‚Äî client-side initialization.

---

### ü§ñ **AI Model Integration**

**Groq Cloud API**  
Used to connect and run inference on hosted AI models through Groq Cloud.

- **Why:** Enables high-performance, low-latency model responses for chat and reasoning tasks.
- **Setup:**
  - Install `groq-sdk`.
  - Add `GROQ_API_KEY` to `.env`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Supporting Stack**

- **Next.js 14** ‚Äî App router-based React framework.
- **React** ‚Äî Component-based UI.
- **Lucide React / React Icons** ‚Äî Icon sets for UI elements.
- **React Hot Toast** ‚Äî Lightweight notifications.
- **Firebase Admin** ‚Äî Secure backend access for Firestore.
